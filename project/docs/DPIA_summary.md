1. Overview

HumanOS Tech is a cognitive and behavioral assessment platform that helps learners, schools, and organizations understand strengths, learning patterns, and progression through interactive tasks.
The system is designed with privacy-first principles, using pseudonymization, data minimization, and strict access controls.

HumanOS does not collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, photos, or biometric data.

2. What Data We Collect

The system only processes:

A. Session Data

Anonymous participant ID (e.g., hp_23af9b3a)

Task responses

Time spent per task

Session start/end timestamps

Difficulty level and task category

B. System Data

Analytics summaries

Adaptive task recommendations

Audit events (e.g., session start, submissions)

No images, voice, biometric data, or personal details are collected in the MVP.

3. Why We Collect This Data

HumanOS uses session data for:

Providing accurate performance insights

Helping teachers and instructors track progress

Suggesting the right difficulty level for each learner

Improving learning outcomes

Maintaining platform safety and integrity

We do not use data for advertising or resale.

4. Who Provides Consent

HumanOS supports multiple deployment models:

Adults (18+)

Participants give their own consent before starting any tasks.

Minors (under 18)

Consent is provided by:

A parent or legal guardian, or

An authorized school official following local regulations

HumanOS records the consent version and timestamp, but does not collect identifiable parent or student information.

5. How Data Is Protected

HumanOS implements multiple layers of protection:

Pseudonymized participant IDs

No PII or biometric data collected

Local data storage (no external processors)

Encrypted transfers (HTTPS recommended)

Rate limiting and bot protection

Strict admin access controls

Separate audit logging for accountability

These measures ensure safety and reduce privacy risks.
